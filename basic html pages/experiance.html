    <h3>Nodejs - Sequelize intern | TST Technology - Ahmedabad</h3>
    <p>
      As a <b>Node.js Developer Intern</b> at a <i>SaaS-based company</i>, I
      gained hands-on experience in developing and maintaining backend services
      using Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize. I collaborated closely with
      cross-functional teams to design and implement RESTful APIs that
      facilitated seamless
      <u
        >communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring high
        performance and security. I optimized database queries, streamlined data
        processing, and implemented caching strategies to improve the overall
        efficiency of the application</u
      >. Additionally, I contributed to the debugging and troubleshooting of
      issues in both staging and production environments, ensuring quick
      resolutions to minimize downtime.
